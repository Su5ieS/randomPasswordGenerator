# randomPasswordGenerator

## Description

This is a random password generator. It has alerts that pop up to inquire about desired password content: number of values needed, lower case, upper case, numbers and special charactors. There is a error alert for the requested number of values if outside of the paramater between 8 and 128. I added a 'clear' button to refresh the page to retry or make an additional password and reselctng the parameters. 

## Usage

This site allows individuals to generate random passwords based on selected criteria. This enhances the security of passwords utilized.
